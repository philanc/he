# he

A small bunch of Lua utility functions

* string extensions (split, strip, ...)
* table and list (map, filter, extend, ...)
* OS and file (ISO date and time, read and write file, shell, ...)
* parsing and encoding (CSV, ...)
* unfinished junk

This stuff is definitely NOT stable, and  NOT maintained.  

hezen.lua and henacl.lua require respectively the  [luazen](https://github.com/philanc/luazen) and [luatweetnacl](https://github.com/philanc/luatweetnacl) extensions.
